The lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) for the variable-coefficient forced Burgers equation (vc-FBE) is studied by choosing the equilibrium distribution and compensatory functions properly. In our model, the vc-FBE is correctly recovered via the Chapman-Enskog analysis. We numerically investigate the dynamic characteristics of solitons caused by the dispersive and external-force terms. Four numerical examples are given, which align well with the theoretical solutions. Our research proves that LBM is a satisfactory and efficient method for nonlinear evolution equations with variable coefficients.
